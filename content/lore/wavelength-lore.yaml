The Shire Folk are deeply connected to nature, their fellow Shire Folk community and artisian crafts.  Often times, you will find Lucky, their resident Wise Elder, fishing in local streams.

    description: Ice Blue Diamonds are rare and precious gemstones found only in the lairs of Ice Dragons. These diamonds are known for their stunning blue color and are highly sought after by collectors and adventurers alike. The process of mining these diamonds is extremely dangerous, as it involves navigating the treacherous ice caves guarded by the dragons.  Lucky used one of these diamonds to lure the Goblin King out of hiding during the Battle for the Shire.

He is tricked by Lucky and the fact that Goblin's Greed is insatiable, into leaving his lair to pursue an Ice Blue Diamond, which Lucky uses to lure him out of hiding during the Battle for the Shire."

Goblins are insatiably greedy and will do anything to get their hands on treasure, especially if it is shiny.  This makes them easy to manipulate, as Lucky discovered when he used an Ice Blue Diamond to lure the Goblin King out of hiding during the Battle for the Shire."
