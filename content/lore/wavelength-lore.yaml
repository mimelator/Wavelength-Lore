    type: place
    description: A quiet realm where peace is abundant, and nature thrives alongside the residents of the Shire who are known as The Shire Folk. The Shire is known for its rolling green hills, crystal-clear streams, and the famous Shire Sanctuary where Wavelength first performed their legendary concerts. The Shire Folk are deeply connected to nature, their fellow Shire Folk community and artisian crafts.  Often times, you will find Lucky, their resident Wise Elder, fishing in local streams.

    type: thing
    description: Ice Blue Diamonds are rare and precious gemstones found only in the lairs of Ice Dragons. These diamonds are known for their stunning blue color and are highly sought after by collectors and adventurers alike. The process of mining these diamonds is extremely dangerous, as it involves navigating the treacherous ice caves guarded by the dragons.  Lucky used one of these diamonds to lure the Goblin King out of hiding during the Battle for the Shire.

    description: "The Goblin King is a Psychopath that leads a Misery of Goblins to invade the Shire and begin the Battle of the Shire.  He lives by one Rule: Goblin's Rule, which means that the only rule you ever need to know about when dealing with the Goblin King, is that he will Rule all over you.  He is tricked by Lucky and the fact that Goblin's Greed is insatiable, into leaving his lair to pursue an Ice Blue Diamond, which Lucky uses to lure him out of hiding during the Battle for the Shire."

    title: Misery of Goblins

    description: "A Misery of Goblins is a goblin horde that is enthralled by the Goblin King to do his bidding.  They are driven by one thing: Greed.  Goblins are insatiably greedy and will do anything to get their hands on treasure, especially if it is shiny.  This makes them easy to manipulate, as Lucky discovered when he used an Ice Blue Diamond to lure the Goblin King out of hiding during the Battle for the Shire."
