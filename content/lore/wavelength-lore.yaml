    type: place
    description: A quiet realm where peace is abundant, and nature thrives alongside the residents of the Shire who are known as The Shire Folk. The Shire is known for its rolling green hills, crystal-clear streams, and the famous Shire Sanctuary where Wavelength first performed their legendary concerts. The Shire Folk are deeply connected to nature, their fellow Shire Folk community and artisian crafts.  Often times, you will find Lucky, their resident Wise Elder, fishing in local streams.

    title: Ice Blue Diamond
    type: thing
    description: Ice Blue Diamonds are rare and precious gemstones found only in the lairs of Ice Dragons. These diamonds are known for their stunning blue color and are highly sought after by collectors and adventurers alike. The process of mining these diamonds is extremely dangerous, as it involves navigating the treacherous ice caves guarded by the dragons.  Lucky used one of these diamonds to lure the Goblin King out of hiding during the Battle for the Shire.
