      story: |
        Wavelength is performing a Shire favorite about their mascot, Lucky the Leprechaun, who brings them good luck and helps them overcome challenges.
        The song celebrates the joy and positivity that Lucky brings to their lives.
        Unfortunately, the lyrics in the song include a dig at the goblins, about how they don't need anyone, which is ironic because goblins are known for being selfish and greedy.
        Eventually, the Goblin King hears about this song and becomes very angry, feeling insulted by the lyrics, and vows to get revenge on Wavelength and the Shire Folk.
      lyrics: |
        When I wake up I look around and see
        Has my luck today run away
        like a frightened little bunny?

        Somedays are good, somedays are bad,
        It doesn't matter to me.

        When I have you, my lucky charm,
        I'll never, never have to say:

        Everyday I need a Lucky Charm
        Who will be my Lucky Charm today?

        Even in the Shire it helps to have a Lucky Charm.
        Unless you're a Goblin, and you need no one.

      story: |
        Wavelength performs a song about taking chances and embracing new experiences, which is especially
        important to them as they are a touring band and love to explore new places and meet new people, cultures, and ideas.
        

      lyrics: |
        I get up just a quarter past midnight
        to get up before the rising sun

        And if you ever see me
        past the midnight hour
        Roll me over, ‘cause you know i am done

        But i’ll keep on crusin’
        Everywhere i’m choosin
        Everywhere that i want to be

        And i try, and i try 
        and I try so hard 
        To be free

        I keep trying to reason about
        Something i can’t understand

        Why you’d choose, why you’d choose
        Why you’d choose a looser
        
        When you could just lend a hand?

        Wavelength performs a song about the Daphne flower, which is known for its intoxicating fragrance that attracts both pollinators and humans.
        It explores themes of attraction, desire, and the allure of beauty, many of which King David expresses for Daphne.
        
      lyrics: |
        You're irresistible, You're irresistible to me

        Why do you always leave me Looking for another flower? 
        For some pollen power?

        Why do you always roam the garden Looking for another source of that golden golden pollen?

      lyrics: |
        Like the voice of an angel When I first heard you sing
        Every second afterwards I've felt the same thing

        I hear your voice and I go ah-ha-ha-ha
        I am falling in love with you

        Time marches forward and things aren't as easy now
        I keep coming back to the things that matter most to me
