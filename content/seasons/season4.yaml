        Wavelength and the Shire Folk escape the Goblin Invasion of the dear Shire, and flee to the far, frozen North. 
        There they find a place to recover and plan at the Ice Fortress.
        THe Ice Fortress is a safe haven for all, where everyone is welcome, no matter wealth or looks or race.
        
      lyrics: |
        Welcome to the Icy Fortress
        We've got room, and food to Spare
        When you're here you'll be protected under our care at the icy fortress!

      story: |
        The Goblin king being a coward at heart, fled the battle before it began, fleeing with his main GOblin Misery back
        to his swampy lair.  He took with him captives from the Shire, including the Royal Family.  Behind the GOblin King
        he left a token force to hold the Shire, so that the Shire Folk wouldn't pursue him.
      
      lyrics: |
        The Goblin King has fled the battle
        He can spread no more lies in the Shire
        No more lying in the shire!
        No Lies!

      story: |
        There is only one motivation for a Goblin, and that is to rule over others.  This is the case for all Goblins,
        from the lowliest grunt to the Goblin King himself.  The Goblin King rules by lying, cheating, and stealing.  He
        has no honor, and no respect for others.  The only rule that the Goblin King has is that Goblins gonna rule all over you.

      lyrics: |
        The Only Goblin Rule for You
        Is that goblins gonna Rule all over you!

        It's no mystery that i'd lie to you
        It's just the way that the Goblin King's rule!

        When I'm speaking you can bet That I'm lying to you
        It's just the way that the Goblin King's rule!

        It's no mystery that i'd lie to you...
        ...that i'd lie to you, and you, and you...

        without a good reason.  Lucky sets a trap for the Goblin King, using an irresistible Ice Blue Diamond as bait.
        The much coveted Ice Blue Diamonds can only be found in the far, frozen North as they are guarded by the fearsome Ice Dragons.

        Yes, we've all heard 'bout the Goblin Greed
        Now the goblin king has his greed fixed on...   
        ...an Ice BLue Diamond

        Lucky set a trap, trap for Goblin Greed
        Showed a goblin spy an irresistible diamond...
        ...stored at the shire

        The deadly lure that lucky cast

      story: |
        The Goblin King, driven by his insatiable greed for the Ice Blue Diamond, leads his goblin horde to attack the fortified Shire.
        The Shire Folk, prepared and determined, stand united to defend their home and freedom. The battle is fierce, with both sides showing great courage and resilience.
        In the end, the Shire Folk's determination and unity prevail, and they successfully defend their home from the Goblin King's forces.

      lyrics: |
        You've gotta Shoot, Shoot for the King
        Stopping his lies are the keys to Everything
        We must destroy, The Mic of the King
        Stopping his lies are the keys to Everything

        There's a goblin misery, with a goblin war machine

        No matter what we try the king's armor is much to strong
        Our magic arrows don't have any affects to stop the king's battle song

        We're getting Desperate Down to our final option
        Bring out the mighty Ballista And aim for the throat of the goblin

        The Goblin King Is not much more than a lying machine
        To kill the king Put an arrow his throat to stop his singing

        We killed the king The Goblins are defeated
        The Gobling King is Dead Yes, we've won back the shire!
        We'll never have to hear him again Or his misery of liars 

        Yes we're back to our shire
        We're Home Yes we're back to the shire

      story: |
        After the battle, the Shire Folk take time to mourn their losses and honor the memories of those who have passed.
        Wavelength didn't escape unscathed, as Wavelength's Drummer: Magical Maurice was lost in the battle.  
        Many others were killed, and many orphans were left behind.  
        One of the orphans is Daphne the daughter of the Shire's Concert Master, who was also killed in the battle along with her father.
        Daphne is left to take care of her younger brother, and as she is a prodigy on the drums, she takes up the mantle of Wavelength's drummer.
        Meanwhile, Eloquence, Wavelength's Bass player is devestated by the loss of Magical Maurice, who was his best friend.  He is not impressed
        with the idea of Daphne taking over as Wavelength's drummer, especially as Daphne seems to be such a bitter person.
        The Song of Mourning is a tribute to those who have passed, and a reminder to hold onto the memories of our loved ones.

      lyrics: |
        There is a time for mourning where we share stories at night,
        ...About a loved one's passing and how we hold those memories tight.
        
        This is the song of Mourning

      story: |
        The Goblin King can no longer spread his lies in the Shire, and the Shire Folk can finally live in peace.
        Wavelength has lost a member, but they have gained a new one in Daphne, who has proven herself to be a worthy drummer.
        What happens next to Daphne and Wavelength will be told over the next many seasons to come....

      lyrics: |
        Some only live for money, Some only live for power.
        But we have a different dream

        Some only shoot for power, Some only live to kill.

        The shire dream, Is a different dream for all humanity
        We dream the shire dream

        We have just one life, one life to live.
        I'll choose to be free and find the shire dream in me.

        Some goblins live in the darkness, Others like to Rule in daylight.

        I'll choose to be free and find the shire dream in me.
