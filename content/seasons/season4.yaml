        Wavelength and the Shire Folk escape the Goblin Invasion of the dear Shire, and flee to the far, frozen North. 
        There they find a place to recover and plan at the Ice Fortress.
        THe Ice Fortress is a safe haven for all, where everyone is welcome, no matter wealth or looks or race.
        
      lyrics: |
        Welcome to the Icy Fortress
        We've got room, and food to Spare
        When you're here you'll be protected under our care at the icy fortress!

      story: |
        The Goblin king being a coward at heart, fled the battle before it began, fleeing with his main GOblin Misery back
        to his swampy lair.  He took with him captives from the Shire, including the Royal Family.  Behind the GOblin King
        he left a token force to hold the Shire, so that the Shire Folk wouldn't pursue him.
      
      lyrics: |
        The Goblin King has fled the battle
        He can spread no more lies in the Shire
        No more lying in the shire!
        No Lies!

      story: |
        There is only one motivation for a Goblin, and that is to rule over others.  This is the case for all Goblins,
        from the lowliest grunt to the Goblin King himself.  The Goblin King rules by lying, cheating, and stealing.  He
        has no honor, and no respect for others.  The only rule that the Goblin King has is that Goblins gonna rule all over you.

      lyrics: |
        The Only Goblin Rule for You
        Is that goblins gonna Rule all over you!

        It's no mystery that i'd lie to you
        It's just the way that the Goblin King's rule!

        When I'm speaking you can bet That I'm lying to you
        It's just the way that the Goblin King's rule!

        It's no mystery that i'd lie to you...
        ...that i'd lie to you, and you, and you...
