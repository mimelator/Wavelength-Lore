        While at the Ice Fortress, the Shire Folk realize they need time to heal.  The Ice Whale Hunt is an 
        annual tradition at the Ice Fortress, and the Shire Folk decide to join in.  They know that they
        need to learn how to fight against the Goblins, and the Ice Whale Hunt is a good time to test their mettle.
        The Ice Whales are the most evil creatures in the deep oceans of the far, Frozen North.  However, while
        completey submerged in the deep depths most of the year, once a year they migrate up to the surface to feed.  
        This is where the Ice Whale Hunt takes place.  The Shire Folk must work together to take down these evil beasts,
        and bring back food to the Ice Fortress.

      lyrics: |
        We're hunting Ice Whales Desperate times call for action
        We're hunting Ice Whales These evil creatures live for your destruction
        'Cause the goblins Have chased from our shire

        We need a place to heal And we need food to survive
        We need our community So we can heal
        We need to survive So for now
        We will hunt the Ice Whales The Ice Whales

        Goblins took our shire So desperate times call for action

        The goblins enjoy spreading terror by sending raiding parties up to the far, frozen North to harass and spy on the Shire Folk.
        The goblins surpise the Shire Folk, but the Shire Folk are ready for them.  They fight back and send the goblins running.
        One more sign that the Shire Folk are getting stronger, and the goblins will need something special to defend the Shire.

      lyrics: |
        It's a sneak attack

        Stealing Shire Folk In the night

        Here we go crossing over the line
        Killing everyone they don't like

        Here they come It's a sneak attack
        Here comes the sneak attack.
        Here's comes it now!

        It's time to fight back to fight for your life!

        Send those goblins back to hell!

      story: |
        The Shire Folk have healed and are ready to take back the Shire.  They know that they will need to be at their best to take back the Shire from the Goblins.
        They are determined to succeed, and they know that they will need to work together to defeat the Goblins.

      lyrics: |
         There's a time for peace And a time for war
         And Since the Goblins stole our shire...
         we prepare for battle yes we prepare for battle!
         It's not the time for peace Oh-oh NO!

         We're marching too a goblin war
         A Misery of Goblins
         We're off to war With the Goblin King

         Yes we prepare for battle!
         It's not the time for Peace Oh-oh NO!

         We've left the safety of the ice fortress behind
         We need to prepare, We need to prepare for battle!

          We need to prepare
          We will reclaim the Shire!
