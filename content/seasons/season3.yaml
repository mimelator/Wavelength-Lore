        Wavelength and the Shire Folk escape the Goblin Invasion of the dear Shire, and flee to the far, frozen North. 
        There they find a place to recover and plan at the Ice Fortress.
        THe Ice Fortress is a safe haven for all, where everyone is welcome, no matter wealth or looks or race.
        
      lyrics: |
        Welcome to the Icy Fortress
        We've got room, and food to Spare
        When you're here you'll be protected under our care at the icy fortress!
        
        In dark times, just like these
        Where shirefolk are left out to freeze
        We still provide your safety in our icy fortress!

        Welcome strangers, all to this place
        We provide for everyone, No matter wealth or looks or race.

        In dark times, just like these
        Where people are snatched from the streets!
        We still provide your safety in our icy fortress!

      story: |
        While at the Ice Fortress, the Shire Folk realize they need time to heal.  The Ice Whale Hunt is an 
        annual tradition at the Ice Fortress, and the Shire Folk decide to join in.  They know that they
        need to learn how to fight against the Goblins, and the Ice Whale Hunt is a good time to test their mettle.
        The Ice Whales are the most evil creatures in the deep oceans of the far, Frozen North.  However, while
        completey submerged in the deep depths most of the year, once a year they migrate up to the surface to feed.  
        This is where the Ice Whale Hunt takes place.  The Shire Folk must work together to take down these evil beasts,
        and bring back food to the Ice Fortress.

      lyrics: |
        We're hunting Ice Whales Desperate times call for action
        We're hunting Ice Whales These evil creatures live for your destruction
        'Cause the goblins Have chased from our shire

        We need a place to heal And we need food to survive
        We need our community So we can heal
        We need to survive So for now
        We will hunt the Ice Whales The Ice Whales

        Goblins took our shire So desperate times call for action

        While at the Ice Fortress, the Shire Folk start the process of dreaming what their new Shire will be like.
        They value freedom, community, and safety above all else.  With that in mind, they begin to craft their plans to rebuild the Shire.

      lyrics: |
        We'll rebuild the shire Yes we can Yes we will one day!
        Let's make the world a better place
        Yes we can. Yes we will one day!
        Let's make the world a safer place
        Get on your feet, we're gonna rebuild one...

        But the shire has been stolen by goblins
        and they won't go away very easily

        Killing everyone they don't like

        Here they come It's a sneak attack
        Here comes the sneak attack.
        Here's comes it now!

        It's time to fight back to fight for your life!
        HOld the LIne Hold the Line Hold the Line!

        There's another goblin I'm gonna shoot 'em down
        Goblin Down!
        We got them on the RUN!

        The Goblins are running... Away!!!
        Yes The Goblins have run... Away!!!

        Decency all stripped away
        Somehow we, we got away
        We will find, Yes we'll find some...

        We're gonna rebuild The Shire Dream Today

        Yes I am the Goblin King And I've got my Misery With Me
        We're gonna gobble up the Shire Folk
        And complete Our Victory So come and get us!

      story: |
        The Shire Folk have healed and are ready to take back the Shire.  They know that they will need to be at their best to take back the Shire from the Goblins.
        They are determined to succeed, and they know that they will need to work together to defeat the Goblins.

      lyrics: |
         There's a time for peace And a time for war
         And Since the Goblins stole our shire...
         we prepare for battle yes we prepare for battle!
         It's not the time for peace Oh-oh NO!

         We're marching too a goblin war
         A Misery of Goblins
         We're off to war With the Goblin King

         Yes we prepare for battle!
         It's not the time for Peace Oh-oh NO!

         We've left the safety of the ice fortress behind
         We need to prepare, We need to prepare for battle!

          We need to prepare
          We will reclaim the Shire!
