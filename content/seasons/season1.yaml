      story: |
        Wavelength is performing a Shire favorite about their mascot, Lucky the Leprechaun, who brings them good luck and helps them overcome challenges.
        The song celebrates the joy and positivity that Lucky brings to their lives.
        Unfortunately, the lyrics in the song include a dig at the goblins, about how they don't need anyone, which is ironic because goblins are known for being selfish and greedy.
        Eventually, the Goblin King hears about this song and becomes very angry, feeling insulted by the lyrics, and vows to get revenge on Wavelength and the Shire Folk.
      lyrics: |
        When I wake up I look around and see
        Has my luck today run away
        like a frightened little bunny?

        Somedays are good, somedays are bad,
        It doesn't matter to me.

        When I have you, my lucky charm,
        I'll never, never have to say:

        Everyday I need a Lucky Charm
        Who will be my Lucky Charm today?

        Even in the Shire it helps to have a Lucky Charm.
        Unless you're a Goblin, and you need no one.

        Wavelength performs a song about taking chances and embracing new experiences, which is especially
        important to them as they are a touring band and love to explore new places and meet new people, cultures, and ideas.
        

      lyrics: |
        I get up just a quarter past midnight
        to get up before the rising sun

        And if you ever see me
        past the midnight hour
        Roll me over, ‘cause you know i am done

        But i’ll keep on crusin’
        Everywhere i’m choosin
        Everywhere that i want to be

        And i try, and i try 
        and I try so hard 
        To be free

        I keep trying to reason about
        Something i can’t understand

        Why you’d choose, why you’d choose
        Why you’d choose a looser
        
        When you could just lend a hand?

      lyrics: |
        You're irresistible, You're irresistible to me

        Why do you always leave me Looking for another flower? 
        For some pollen power?

        Why do you always roam the garden Looking for another source of that golden golden pollen?

        Wavelength performs a poignant song about cherishing memories and the importance of remembering loved ones who have passed away.
        The song reflects on the enduring impact that these individuals have on our lives and the comfort that comes from holding onto their memory.

      lyrics: |
        Do you remember all those moments that we used to share?
        Do you remember all the times that we used to care?
        Do you remember all those mountains that we used to climb?
        Do you remember It was always your hand in mine?

        There was nothing that could happen
        nothing that could ever tear us apart

        It was quite the sight Friendship every night Living heart to heart

        Oh do you remember when?

        Johnny went first then Jason went too
        They had grand plans and things to do
        Tommy got into a much darker scene
        and Jewel's bright light was snuffed out by the machine

        Once more, once more Once more, once more To see you again!

        I realize that fates have been cruel
        to take you away a young precious jewel
        and forever I'll remember you

        I realize that our fates are entwined
        and though you were struck by the cruel hands of time
        that forever I'll remember you

        la-da-da-da-da (I will remember)
        You're a precious jewel who Shines with the stars at night  
        forever, I'll remember you

      lyrics: |
        After the fire and all of the flames have been swept away 
        Life in the Shire comes to an end another day

        After the fire and all of the flames from another day
        LIfe in the furnace seems to be burning our lives away
        But we can retreat back where our lives are sweet

        Back to the place where we belong!

        After the fire and all of the flames have been swept away 
        We clean the ash and the dust and just let it drift away
        And all we have left is just what is best
        We have a family!

        Just remember that even after all
        All the pain and suffering... you survived it all
        And your standing tall and your standing strong
        And now you can help Some other crows along

      lyrics: |
        We’re coming back,  we’re coming back
        There is a place I like to go  At least once a year
        Where the sun shines bright The days are long And the air is clear

        Yes I’m coming back,  Yes I’m coming back to the Shire 

        There is a place Where water and land  have a tidal affair
        Where the people are kind The food is good,  and the hate is rare

        There is a place I like to go once a year
        And in that space Heaven is near
