      story: |
        After the Goblin King found out about the insult at the Shire, he decided to invade with his Misery of Goblins.
        Wavelength didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. The Goblins took over the Shire and Wavelength was forced to perform a Concert for the Goblin King.

      lyrics: |
          You've been punched in the head So many times 
          That you don't know which way is left or right
          So you gonna hate all that you see 

          And You don't know which way to turn So you turn to company
          And do you know what?  They don't give a damn about you or me

          You can call me boss Today And grovel at my feet
          Or you can call me king and I'll still never remember Your Little Name

          You can call me King All day And bow like your head's at stake
          It don't matter to me That's why I'm the Goblin King
          Yes you can bow to me  I'm the Goblin King!
          That I'm the Goblins' King of this whole show

      story: |
        Wavelength is forced to perform for the Goblin King. So thinking quickly on the spot, 
          Wavelength writes a song about being a Psychopath, hoping to impress the Goblin King with Worldview
          that the Goblin can appreciate. This helps to put the Goblin King off of his guard in order to escape.

      lyrics: |
          He's a psycho-psycho-psychopath

          I'm a psycho-psycho-psychopath
          and I'm gonna take what's yours...

          Everyday I see what's yours and soon i'll be taking it away
          'cause that's my way How I go through all my days
          I'm a psychopathic wizard and I'm gonna blow you all away

          I'm a psycho-psycho-psychopath and I'm gonna take what's yours...
          ...and give it all away!

          Well there's never been a better path
          then livin' your life as a psychopath!

      story: |
        Wavelength is struck by the realization that the Goblins mean to kill and rule the Shire Forever.
        They realize that in times of crisis, people come together to help each other, and the most important
        resource you have in times of crisis is your friends and family.

      lyrics: |
          There's a countdown in the background of every living thing
          you better know what to look for Or you won't stay in the ring

          There's a countdown to living There's a countdown to the end
          So if you're lucky  you should hold on
          to someone that you can call friend

          Until the dark time is past
          Gather together for what warmth you can have
          And when the terror tightens its grip,
          Give your loved ones a kiss!

        believes that misery is the only way to live, and that everyone should be miserable like him.

      lyrics: |

          Misery is our dream
          So come along and sing this song
