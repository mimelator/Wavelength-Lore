      story: |
        After the Goblin King found out about the insult at the Shire, he decided to invade with his Misery of Goblins.
        Wavelength didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. The Goblins took over the Shire and Wavelength was forced to perform a Concert for the Goblin King.

      lyrics: |
          You've been punched in the head So many times 
          That you don't know which way is left or right
          So you gonna hate all that you see 

          And You don't know which way to turn So you turn to company
          And do you know what?  They don't give a damn about you or me

          You can call me boss Today And grovel at my feet
          Or you can call me king and I'll still never remember Your Little Name

          You can call me King All day And bow like your head's at stake
          It don't matter to me That's why I'm the Goblin King
          Yes you can bow to me  I'm the Goblin King!
          That I'm the Goblins' King of this whole show

        The Goblin King is a Psychopath. He doesn't care about anyone but himself. He takes what he wants and doesn't care who he hurts in the process. Wavelength is starting to realize that he is not to be trusted.

      lyrics: |
          Everyday I see what's yours
          And I think about taking it all away
          'Cause I don't care about you
          I just want to see you suffer

          You can try to run away
          But you can't hide from me
          I'm a psychopath
          And I don't care about anyone but me

          You can try to fight back
          But you can't win against me
          I'm a psychopath
          And I don't care about anyone but me

          I'm a psychopath
          And I don't care about anyone but me
