      story: |
        After the Goblin King found out about the insult at the Shire, he decided to invade with his Misery of Goblins.
        Wavelength didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. The Goblins took over the Shire and Wavelength was forced to perform a Concert for the Goblin King.

      lyrics: |
          You've been punched in the head So many times 
          That you don't know which way is left or right
          So you gonna hate all that you see 

          And You don't know which way to turn So you turn to company
          And do you know what?  They don't give a damn about you or me

          You can call me boss Today And grovel at my feet
          Or you can call me king and I'll still never remember Your Little Name

          You can call me King All day And bow like your head's at stake
          It don't matter to me That's why I'm the Goblin King
          Yes you can bow to me  I'm the Goblin King!
          That I'm the Goblins' King of this whole show

          He's a psycho-psycho-psychopath

          'cause that's my way How I go through all my days
          I'm a psychopathic wizard and I'm gonna blow you all away

          I'm a psycho-psycho-psychopath and I'm gonna take what's yours...
          ...and give it all away!

          Well there's never been a better path

      story: |
        Wavelength is struck by the realization that the Goblins mean to kill and rule the Shire Forever.
        They realize that in times of crisis, people come together to help each other, and the most important
        resource you have in times of crisis is your friends and family.

      lyrics: |
          There's a countdown in the background of every living thing
          you better know what to look for Or you won't stay in the ring

          There's a countdown to living There's a countdown to the end
          So if you're lucky  you should hold on
          to someone that you can call friend

          Until the dark time is past
          Gather together for what warmth you can have
          And when the terror tightens its grip,
          Give your loved ones a kiss!

          Misery is our Dream

          Everybody gather 'round
          Come here the secret that I have found
          MIsery isn't quite what it used to be
          Now let us celebrate We are no longer free!
          We are no longer free

          Welcome everybody to your new life

          No we're no longer free
          MIsery loves Company
          Like an goblin kept in an Ice Cold Cell
          MIsery loves Company Like a demon in hell

        Wavelength is about to make a large decision that will affect the future of the Shire.  They could either
        save themselves by giving in to the Goblins, or they could try to fight back and save the Shire.
        But in order to rescue the Shire Folk, they know that they must be willing to risk their own safety.
        Wavelength realizes that in order to make the right decision, they must take their time and think
        about what is truly important in life.

      lyrics: |
        For every moment that you live
        You can choose to give your hate away
        And every moment that you give
        Into the greed Your soul will drift away
        It will drift away

        This is the slow time of life
        When you choose wrong from right 'cause it could matter
        This is the slow time of our lives
        Where we choose what really matters...
        ...To Keep us alive 

        As we gather around
        We can ask Our we on the same team?
        Do we still dream the same dream?
        And in the time of choosing...
        Do you think? Do you think we should all be free?

        Free to sing!

        Wavelength uses this knowledge to create a plan to escape the Goblins by using science to create a distraction.
        Wavelength creates a machine that creates a loud noise that scares the Goblins away, allowing Wavelength to escape
        and save the Shire.

      lyrics: |
        No you won't see it coming When i wreck, wreck your world
        You can't see, 'cause you live in a lie
        You're just a goblin in disguise
        You don't know what a virus is
        How it rules, rules our lives
        Every lie that the goblins bring
        Takes your soul a little farther from... true peace

        No you can't see the virus
        When you live in a goblin lie
        No your goblin mind, Can't possibly Understand a little word

        No you won't see all the chaos That a virus can become
        No you can't see that you...
        ...and the virus have become one.

        No you can't see this virus 'cause it's just out of sight
        Don't you know that every little thing...
        ...that you've been taught is a goblin lie?
        A Goblin lie!

      story: |
        Wavelength springs the trap that put the Goblins to sleep.  Wavelength and the Shire Folk escape the Goblins and 
        begin their long journey to the far, frozen North, where their adventure continues in Season 3: The Ice Fortress.

      lyrics: |
        And now it's time to say goodbye To all my goblin friends
        Thank you much for your company,
        But here is where our friendship ends.

        I can't spend anytime again with you 
        It's not because of me, It's because of you

        And now it's time to say goodbye to the shire

        Get out! Escape right now!
        While you still have a chance to live
        Get out! We can return to rebuild the shire

        Though we've left the goblins behind Back at the shire
        There greed will never end, It requires more...
        ...and more...
        ...and more and more and more...
