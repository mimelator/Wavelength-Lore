A photorealistic scene of a concert at a large solemn bonfire.  Surrounding the bonfire are a large circle of stones that have bioluminescent mushrooms and glowing crows carved into them.

Next to the Bonfire, on an improvised stage, there is a band of musicians performing.

At center stage, a half-elf singer with human ears, long snow white hair, glowing lavender eyes, and a crow pin on his upturned-collar tunic passionately sings into a modern microphone while strumming a luminous lute-guitar that radiates vivid, prismatic waves of energy.

Beside him, a regal half-elf woman with a tiara and long golden braids plays a jewel-encrusted, radiant harp, her faintly glowing green eyes serene above her elegant dress. A tall, athletic quarter-elf woman in a pale lavender skirt bows her energy-laced violin, sandy brown hair flowing; next, a sandy-haired teenage boy intensely plucks an upright bass.

Furiously drumming a blazing blue-flamed kit is a fiery redhead girl with a black eye patch, heavy eyeliner, and sparks flying from cymbals. 


The rapt audience of halflings and woodland animals—rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, chipmunks—mix among luminous crows and fluttering forest faeries under the mossy arch.

The crowd gathered around the bonfire is full of halflings and woodland creatures including: rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes and chipmunks.  There are glowing crows and forest faeries amongst the audience of the performance.

A YETI and a leprechaun are standing next to each other and the leprechaun has his hat held in his hands.

Cinematic spotlights, dynamic blue neon accents, and electrifying festival atmosphere saturate the scene.
