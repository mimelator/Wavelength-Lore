VERSION ONE -> WIDE SHOTS A LOT

A photorealistic ice fortress carved into the side of a granite mountain in winter light hosts a surreal neon-lit concert stage. The Concert stage is a large fantastical ice stage to allow the audience to see the performers.  Large Ice Dragons circle overhead. There are hanging chandeliers that cast neon colored spotlights to showcase the stage.

At the center, a half-elf with human ears and long snow white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone.  He is strumming a glowing lute-guitar that radiates vivid energy waves. He has glowing lavendar eyes, and wears a long tunic with an up turned collar, and wears a crow pin on his tunic.

Next to him, is a regal looking half elf woman sits on an elegant stool while playing a fullsized luminous harp that radiates vivid energy waves.  The wooden harp has sparkling jewels inlaid into it that catch the light and reflect prisms.  She has faintly glowing green eyes, short ears and wears a long elegant dress with a tiara.  She has long golden braids that run down her back.

Next to her is a free spirited quarter-elf lady bows her violin that radiates vivid energy waves. She is tall, athletic and graceful with sandy brown hair and is wearing a pale lavendar skirt.

Next to her is a tall sandy haired teenage boy is intensely plucking the strings of an upgright bass. His hair is just long enough to cover the back of his neck and reaches one of his eyes.

A heavily bearded large dwarf bangs on an ancient drum which raidates glowing power of energy.

The audience is full of arctic foxes, snow rabbits, pixies, fairies and many woodland creatures like: rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, chipmunks.  The crowd stares in raptured silence as they watch the performers on stage.

Towering ancient ceilings of ice arch overhead, with intricate engravings of bioluminescent mushrooms and glowing crows and ICE Whale Skeletons.
At the foot of the stage are some goblin gear that has been collected.  It is scattered about like a spear and a helmet.

There is light falling snow and a leprechaun attempts to fish out of an ice fishing hole on the side of the stage.

Cinematic spotlights, dynamic blue neon accents, and electrifying festival atmosphere saturate the scene.
