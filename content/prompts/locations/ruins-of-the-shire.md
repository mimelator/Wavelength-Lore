CONCERT IN THE RUINS:

A photorealistic spring day in the Shire bathed in dim golden hour light seamlessly transforms into a surreal neon-lit concert stage. The Concert stage is an open grass land, with improvised war debris for the performers to stand on.

At the center, a half-elf with human ears and long snow white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone.  He is strumming a glowing lute-guitar that radiates vivid energy waves. He has glowing lavendar eyes, and wears a long tunic with an up turned collar, and wears a crow pin on his tunic.

Next to him, is a regal looking half elf woman sits on an elegant stool while playing a fullsized luminous harp that radiates vivid energy waves.  The wooden harp has sparkling jewels inlaid into it that catch the light and reflect prisms.  She has faintly glowing green eyes, short ears and wears a long elegant dress with a tiara.  She has long golden braids that run down her back.

Next to her is a free spirited quarter-elf lady bows her violin that radiates vivid energy waves. She is tall, athletic and graceful with sandy brown hair and is wearing a pale lavendar skirt.

Next to her is a tall sandy haired teenage boy is intensely plucking the strings of an upgright bass. His hair is just long enough to cover the back of his neck and reaches one of his eyes.

A heavily bearded large dwarf bangs on an ancient drum which raidates glowing power of energy.  He wears a tie-dye kilt
The audience is full of battle weary halflings and woodland creatures including: rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes and chipmunks.  The creatures all have either helmets of war, or spears, or knives, or bows and arrows as they are have recently fought a battle.

The YETI is tending to the wounded halflings.  There are glowing crows and forest faeries amongst the ruins of the shire, and a leprechaun is looking at the polluted river with a fishing pole in hand, but not using it.
