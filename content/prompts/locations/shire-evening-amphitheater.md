VERSION ONE

A photorealistic mossy ancient wooden amphitheater hosts surreal neon-lit concert stage.  There are  Lucky Charm horseshoe engravings as well as intricate engravings of bioluminescent mushrooms and glowing crows carved into the amphitheater.

At the center, a half-elf with human ears and long snow white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone.  He is strumming a glowing lute-guitar that radiates vivid energy waves. He has glowing lavendar eyes, and wears a long tunic with an up turned collar, and wears a crow pin on his tunic.

Next to him, is a regal looking half elf woman sits on an elegant stool while playing a fullsized luminous harp that radiates vivid energy waves.  The wooden harp has sparkling jewels inlaid into it that catch the light and reflect prisms.  She has faintly glowing green eyes, short ears and wears a long elegant dress with a tiara.  She has long golden braids that run down her back.

Next to her is a free spirited quarter-elf lady bows her violin that radiates vivid energy waves. She is tall, athletic and graceful with sandy brown hair and is wearing a pale lavendar skirt.

Next to her is a tall sandy haired teenage boy is intensely plucking the strings of an upgright bass. His hair is just long enough to cover the back of his neck and reaches one of his eyes.


Next to him is a Fiery Red Headed Girl with a black patch over her left eye is furiously drumming at a bright red drum kit.  Radiant Sparks of energy fly off the cymbals, and the drum heads seem to be slightly on fire with blue flames.  On her other eye, she wears heavy eyeliner to accentuate her mood.


The audience is full of halflings and woodland creatures including: rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes and chipmunks.
There are glowing crows and forest faeries amongst the audience of the performance.

Towering ancient wooden amphitheater of mossy arch overhead, 

A leprechaun attempts to fish just off stage where a creek is running past the stage.

Cinematic spotlights, dynamic blue neon accents, and electrifying festival atmosphere saturate the scene.

VERSION TWO


A surreal, photorealistic scene of an ancient moss-covered wooden amphitheater aglow with dynamic blue neon accents and theatrical spotlights. The stage shimmers with Lucky Charm horseshoe engravings and intricate bioluminescent carvings of mushrooms and glowing crows.

At center, a half-elf singer with human ears, long snow white hair, glowing lavender eyes, and a crow pin on his upturned-collar tunic passionately sings into a modern microphone while strumming a luminous lute-guitar that radiates vivid, prismatic waves of energy.

Beside him, a regal half-elf woman with a tiara and long golden braids plays a jewel-encrusted, radiant harp, her faintly glowing green eyes serene above her elegant dress. A tall, athletic quarter-elf woman in a pale lavender skirt bows her energy-laced violin, sandy brown hair flowing; next, a sandy-haired teenage boy intensely plucks an upright bass.

Furiously drumming a blazing blue-flamed kit is a fiery redhead girl with a black eye patch, heavy eyeliner, and sparks flying from cymbals. The rapt audience of halflings and woodland animals—rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, chipmunks—mix among luminous crows and fluttering forest faeries under the mossy arch.

Offstage by a babbling creek, a whimsical leprechaun attempts to fish, completing the electrifying enchanted festival atmosphere.
