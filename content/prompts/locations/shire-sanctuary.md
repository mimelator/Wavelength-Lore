A photorealistic scene of a concert at a great hall at a halfling's village there are towering engraved glass windows behind the stage that allows bright rays of sunlight to stream onto the stage.  The engravings areof Lucky Charm horseshoes bioluminescent mushrooms and glowing crows.

On the raised dias of the stage,  At the center, a half-elf with human ears and long snow white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone.  He is strumming a glowing lute-guitar that radiates vivid energy waves. He has glowing lavendar eyes, and wears a long tunic with an up turned collar, and wears a crow pin on his tunic.

Next to him, is a regal looking half elf woman sits on an elegant stool while playing a fullsized luminous harp that radiates vivid energy waves.  The wooden harp has sparkling jewels inlaid into it that catch the light and reflect prisms.  She has faintly glowing green eyes, short ears and wears a long elegant dress with a tiara.  She has long golden braids that run down her back.

Next to her is a free spirited quarter-elf lady bows her violin that radiates vivid energy waves. She is tall, athletic and graceful with sandy brown hair and is wearing a pale lavendar skirt.

Next to her is a tall sandy haired teenage boy is intensely plucking the strings of an upgright bass. His hair is just long enough to cover the back of his neck and reaches one of his eyes.

Next to him and furiously drumming a blazing blue-flamed kit is a fiery redhead girl with a black eye patch, heavy eyeliner, and sparks flying from cymbals. 

The crowd of halflings and woodland creatures filling the great hall include: rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes and chipmunks.  There are glowing crows and forest faeries flying through the great hall.

Cinematic spotlights, dynamic blue neon accents, and electrifying festival atmosphere saturate the scene.
