VERSION ONE

A photorealistic staging campsite that hosts an impromptu surreal neon-lit concert stage next to a large community campfire where the audience is camping out. The Concert stage is a hastily constructed wooden stage that allow the audience to see the performers.  It is set on a high plains grasslands with a long range of tall, white mountains in the background.

At the center, a half-elf with human ears and long snow white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone.  He is strumming a glowing lute-guitar that radiates vivid energy waves. He has glowing lavendar eyes, and wears a long tunic with an up turned collar, and wears a crow pin on his tunic.

Next to him, is a regal looking half elf woman sits on an elegant stool while playing a fullsized luminous harp that radiates vivid energy waves.  The wooden harp has sparkling jewels inlaid into it that catch the light and reflect prisms.  She has faintly glowing green eyes, short ears and wears a long elegant dress with a tiara.  She has long golden braids that run down her back.

Next to her is a free spirited quarter-elf lady bows her violin that radiates vivid energy waves. She is tall, athletic and graceful with sandy brown hair and is wearing a pale lavendar skirt.

Next to her is a tall sandy haired teenage boy is intensely plucking the strings of an upgright bass. His hair is just long enough to cover the back of his neck and reaches one of his eyes.

A heavily bearded large dwarf bangs on an ancient drum which raidates glowing power of energy.  He wears a tie-dye kilt

The audience includes many small animals like: rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes and chipmunks.
Also included are more fantastical creatures like a happy yeti, forest fairies and a leprechaun.  The audience members all have either helmets of war, or spears, or knives, or bows and arrows as they are having a final meeting before battle.

The Stars twinkle at night and one shooting star streaks aross the sky high in the night above the stage.

A leprechaun attempts to fish out of a small creek that runs next to the side of the stage.

Cinematic spotlights, dynamic blue neon accents, and electrifying festival atmosphere saturate the scene.

VERSION TWO

A hyper-realistic nighttime campsite blends into sweeping high plains grasslands, with a striking backdrop of tall, snowcapped white mountains under a star-studded sky. At the campsite’s center, a makeshift wooden concert stage is ablaze with surreal neon lights, illuminating the performers and casting vibrant reflections on the crowd huddled around a large community campfire.

Leading the band, a half-elf with human ears and long snow-white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone, strumming a radiant, glowing lute-guitar emitting vivid energy waves; his glowing lavender eyes and upturned-collar tunic, adorned with a crow pin, shimmer in the colored light.

Beside him, a regal half-elf woman with faintly glowing green eyes, golden braids, a tiara, and an elegant dress gracefully plays a full-sized luminous harp jeweled with prisms, while a graceful, athletic quarter-elf woman in a pale lavender skirt bows her violin, radiating magical colors.

A tall, sandy-haired teen plucks an upright bass with intensity, and a large bearded dwarf in a tie-dye kilt hammers an ancient drum pulsating with energy. The diverse audience—rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, chipmunks, a jubilant yeti, forest fairies, and a leprechaun—are armed for battle, their helmets, spears, knives, and bows aglow in the neon.

Overhead, a bright shooting star blazes across the night sky, lending a magical, momentous mood to this surreal, cinematic pre-battle concert scene.
