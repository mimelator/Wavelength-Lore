VERSION ONE
A hyper-detailed, photorealistic spring forest at golden hour transforms into a surreal open field. At the center, a half-elf with human ears and long snow white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone.

He is strumming a glowing lute-guitar that radiates vivid energy waves. He has glowing lavendar eyes, and wears a long tunic with an up turned collar, and wears a crow pin on his tunic.

The surrounding landscape is filled with quaint halfling houses and smoking chimneys.  The trees are carved with glowing bioluminescent mushrooms and crows and a lucky charm horsehoe.
There is streaming golden light rays cast through the towering oaks 

VERSION TWO
A hyper-detailed, photorealistic spring forest at golden hour opens to a surreal field where a half-elf with human ears and long snow white hair passionately sings into a modern microphone.

He strums a glowing lute-guitar, pulsing with vivid energy waves, his lavender eyes illuminated. He wears a long tunic with an upturned collar and a crow pin. Behind him, quaint halfling houses with smoking chimneys dot the rolling grass.

Towering oaks arch overhead, their trunks carved with glowing bioluminescent mushrooms, perched crows, and a horseshoe lucky charm. Streaming golden sunlight pierces the canopy, bathing the fantastical landscape in radiant warmth and brilliant atmosphere.
