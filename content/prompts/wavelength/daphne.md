A hyper-detailed, photorealistic spring forest at golden hour transforms into a surreal open field. At the center, a Fiery Red Headed Girl with a black patch over her left eye is furiously drumming at a bright red drum kit.  Radiant Sparks of energy fly off the cymbals, and the drum heads seem to be slightly on fire with blue flames.

On her other eye, she wears heavy eyeliner to accentuate her mood.

The surrounding landscape is filled with quaint halfling houses and smoking chimneys.  The trees are carved with glowing bioluminescent mushrooms and crows and a lucky charm horsehoe.
There is streaming golden light rays cast through the towering oaks
