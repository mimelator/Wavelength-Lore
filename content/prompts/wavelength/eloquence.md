VERSION TWO

In a hyper-detailed, photorealistic spring forest illuminated by streaming golden hour light, the scene transitions into an expansive, surreal open field.

At the center stands a tall, sandy-haired teenage boy with hair just long enough to cover the back of his neck and obscuring one of his eyes. He is intensely plucking the strings of an upright bass, fingers blurred in motion.

All around, charming halfling houses with mossy roofs and smoking chimneys nestle beneath towering oaks. Tree trunks are carved with glowing bioluminescent mushrooms, perched crows, and an embedded lucky charm horseshoe.

Shafts of brilliant sunlight filter through dense foliage, creating a magical atmosphere that blends fantasy and realism. The lush greenery, intricate textures, and luminous effects evoke a vivid, cinematic landscape teeming with whimsical detail and musical energy.
