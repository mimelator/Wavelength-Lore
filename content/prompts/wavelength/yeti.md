VERSION TWO

A hyper-detailed, photorealistic spring forest at golden hour seamlessly transitions into a surreal open field. At the center stands a ferocious-looking yeti adorned with an efficient nurse's hat, clutching a first aid kit in one massive hand.

The verdant landscape is dotted with quaint halfling houses, each with mossy roofs and smoking stone chimneys. Towering oaks cast streaming golden light rays, their bark intricately carved and adorned with glowing bioluminescent mushrooms, perched crows, and a lucky charm horseshoe.

Crisp, radiant sunlight and atmospheric mist illuminate fine textures across foliage, fur, and fantasy architecture, evoking magical realism.
