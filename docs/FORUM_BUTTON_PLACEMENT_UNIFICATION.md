# Forum Button Placement Unification

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
The "Create a Post" button placement was inconsistent across different content types:
- **Episodes & Characters**: Button placed immediately after title, before main content
- **Lore**: Button placed after description, below main content

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**
Unified the forum button placement to follow UX best practices by moving the lore forum button to match the episode and character placement.

## 📍 **New Unified Placement**
All content types now follow the same structure:
```
Title (H1)
↓
[Type Badge] (lore only)
↓
🎯 Forum "Create Post" Button
↓
Main Visual Content (banner/carousel)
↓
Description/Summary
↓
Related Content/Navigation
```

## 🎨 **Visual Consistency Maintained**
- **Episodes**: "💬 Create a Post for this Episode" (Purple #4a47a3)
- **Characters**: "🗣️ Create a Post about this Hero" (Purple #6a4c93)  
- **Lore**: "🌟 Create a Post about this Lore" (Type-based colors)

## 🚀 **UX Benefits**

### 1. **Early Visibility**
- Users see engagement options immediately upon landing

### 2. **Consistent Experience**
