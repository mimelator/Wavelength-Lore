# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE GUIDE üö®

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **ROTATE ALL EXPOSED CREDENTIALS IMMEDIATELY**

The following credentials were exposed in your GitHub repository and must be rotated:

#### Firebase Credentials:
- **API Key**: `YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY` ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPOSED (but cannot be changed)
- **Project ID**: `wavelength-lore` 
- **App ID**: `YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID` ‚ùå COMPROMISED (this CAN be changed)

#### AWS Credentials:
- **Access Key ID**: `AKIASPFRQ6WB5DS[REDACTED]` ‚ùå COMPROMISED  
- **Secret Access Key**: `Oh5MSAmKb7NUyJ9v[REDACTED]` ‚ùå COMPROMISED

#### YouTube API Key:
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyDEsAFgYaBlttBdjh[REDACTED]` ‚ùå COMPROMISED

### 2. **IMMEDIATE STEPS TO TAKE**

#### A. Firebase Security - DETAILED STEPS:

**Step 1: Access Firebase Console**
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Login with your Google account
3. Click on your "wavelength-lore" project

**Step 2: Find Your Web App**
1. Once in your project, look for a **gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è** in the left sidebar (next to "Project Overview")
2. Click the gear icon and select **"Project settings"**
3. In the Project Settings page, scroll down to **"Your apps"** section
4. You should see a web app with an icon that looks like **`</>`** 

**Step 3: Get Current Config (BEFORE deleting)**
1. Click on the web app (the `</>` icon)
2. Scroll down and click **"Config"** 
3. **COPY the config object** - you'll need the structure but with NEW values
4. It should look like:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
     authDomain: "wavelength-lore.firebaseapp.com",
     databaseURL: "https://wavelength-lore-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
     projectId: "wavelength-lore",
     storageBucket: "wavelength-lore.firebasestorage.app",
     messagingSenderId: "123456789",
     appId: "1:123456789:web:abcd1234"
   };
   ```

**Step 4: Delete the Compromised Web App**
1. Still in the web app settings, scroll down
2. Look for **"Delete app"** button (usually at the bottom)
3. Click **"Delete app"**
4. Type the app name to confirm deletion
5. Click **"Delete app"** to confirm

**Step 5: Create New Web App**
1. Back in Project Settings, in the "Your apps" section
2. Click **"Add app"** button
3. Select the **Web platform** (the `</>` icon)
4. Enter an app nickname (like "Wavelength Lore Forum")
5. **Check the box** "Also set up Firebase Hosting" (optional)
6. Click **"Register app"**

**Step 6: Get New Config**
1. Firebase will show you the new config object
2. **COPY this entire config** - these are your NEW safe credentials
3. **IMPORTANT**: The `apiKey` will be the SAME (it's project-level), but `appId` will be different
4. The NEW `appId` is what makes this secure - it's a new app registration
5. Click **"Continue to console"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFICATION: Why API Key Stays the Same**
- The `apiKey` is **project-level** - it doesn't change when you create new apps
- The `appId` is **app-specific** - this is what changes and provides security
- Think of it like: same building (project/apiKey), new apartment number (appId)

**üö® IMPORTANT: You CANNOT Change the Firebase Project API Key**
- Firebase API keys are **permanent** and tied to the project
- If you need a completely new API key, you would need to create a **new Firebase project**
- **However, this is NOT necessary for security!** Here's why:

**Alternative Security Approaches (RECOMMENDED):**

**Option 1: Firebase App Check (Recommended)**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí App Check
2. Enable App Check for your web app
3. This adds an additional security layer beyond the API key
4. Prevents unauthorized apps from using your Firebase resources

**Option 2: Restrict API Key Usage**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials  
2. Click on your Firebase API key
3. Add **Application restrictions**:
   - HTTP referrers: `*.wavelength-lore.com`, `localhost:*`
   - This prevents the key from being used on other domains

**Option 3: Firebase Security Rules**
1. Strengthen your Firebase Database security rules
2. Require authentication for all operations
3. Limit read/write access based on user authentication

**Why the current approach IS secure:**
- ‚úÖ Old `appId` deleted (this is the main security benefit)
- ‚úÖ API key restrictions can be added (Google Cloud Console)
- ‚úÖ Firebase App Check provides additional protection
- ‚úÖ Database security rules control access

**Step 7: Update Your .env File**
Replace your .env values with the NEW ones:
```bash
API_KEY="same_as_before_this_is_normal"  # ‚úÖ This stays the same - it's project-level
AUTH_DOMAIN="wavelength-lore.firebaseapp.com"  # This stays the same
DATABASE_URL="https://wavelength-lore-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"  # This stays the same
PROJECT_ID="wavelength-lore"  # This stays the same
STORAGE_BUCKET="wavelength-lore.firebasestorage.app"  # This stays the same
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_new_sender_id"  # This might change
APP_ID="your_new_app_id"  # ‚úÖ This WILL be different - this is the key security change
```

**üîë SECURITY EXPLANATION:**
- **API Key staying the same is NORMAL** - it's tied to your Firebase project
- **APP_ID changing is what provides security** - it's a new app registration
- The compromised config had both the API key AND the specific App ID
- By changing the App ID, you've invalidated the old configuration

**Step 8: Test Your Application**
1. Save your updated `.env` file
2. Restart your Node.js application
3. Test that Firebase connection still works
4. **NO FIREBASE CLI COMMANDS NEEDED** - just update .env and restart app

**IMPORTANT: What you DON'T need to do:**
- ‚ùå `firebase login` - Not needed for web app config changes
- ‚ùå `firebase init` - Not needed, your project is already initialized  
- ‚ùå `firebase deploy` - Not needed unless you're using Firebase Hosting
- ‚ùå Any Firebase CLI commands - The web app config is just client credentials

**What you ARE doing:**
- ‚úÖ Just replacing client-side configuration values
- ‚úÖ Your database, hosting, and functions stay exactly the same
- ‚úÖ Only the frontend connection credentials change

#### B. AWS Security - DETAILED BEST PRACTICES:

**Step 1: Access AWS Console**
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Login to your AWS account
3. Navigate to **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** service

**Step 2: Delete Compromised Key IMMEDIATELY**
1. In IAM, click **"Users"** in left sidebar
2. Find and click on the user that owns key: **AKIASPFRQ6WB5DS[REDACTED]**
3. Click **"Security credentials"** tab
4. Find the access key **AKIASPFRQ6WB5DS[REDACTED]**
5. Click **"Delete"** and confirm deletion
6. **DO THIS FIRST** - Don't create new key until old one is deleted

**Step 3: Review What Permissions You Actually Need**
Before creating a new key, determine minimal permissions needed:
- **S3 bucket access?** (for file uploads)
- **CloudFront distributions?** (for CDN)
- **SES email sending?** (for notifications)
- **Lambda functions?** (for serverless)

**Step 4: Create New Access Key with MINIMAL Permissions**

**Option A: Create IAM User with Limited Permissions (RECOMMENDED)**
1. In IAM, click **"Users"** ‚Üí **"Create user"**
2. Username: `wavelength-lore-app-user`
3. **Attach policies directly** ‚Üí Click **"Create policy"**
4. Use **Visual Editor** and add ONLY what you need:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:DeleteObject"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
5. Name the policy: `WavelengthLoreMinimalPolicy`
6. Attach this policy to your new user
7. Create access key for this user

**Step 5: Security Best Practices for New Key**
1. **Enable MFA** on the AWS account (not the key, but the root account)
2. **Set up CloudTrail** to log all API calls
3. **Enable AWS Config** to monitor configuration changes
4. **Use least privilege** - only grant permissions you actually use
5. **Rotate keys every 90 days** (set calendar reminder)
6. **Never commit keys to code** (you already learned this!)

**Step 6: Additional Security Measures**
1. **IP Restrictions**: In IAM policy, add IP restrictions if possible:
   ```json
   {
     "Condition": {
       "IpAddress": {
         "aws:SourceIp": ["YOUR.SERVER.IP.HERE/32"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. **Time-based Access**: Restrict access to business hours if appropriate
3. **Resource Restrictions**: Lock down to specific S3 buckets/resources only

**Step 7: Test New Credentials**
1. Update your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_new_access_key"
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_new_secret_key"
   AWS_REGION="us-east-1"  # or your preferred region
   ```
2. Test AWS functionality in your app
3. Monitor CloudTrail for the first few API calls to ensure they work

**Step 8: Monitor for Unauthorized Usage**
1. Check **CloudTrail Event History** for the old compromised key
2. Look for any API calls you didn't make
3. Check your **AWS Billing** for unexpected charges
4. Set up **AWS Budgets** alerts for unusual spending

#### C. YouTube/Google API Security - DETAILED NAVIGATION:

**Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console (NOT Firebase Console)**
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ (different from Firebase!)
2. Login with your Google account
3. **Select the correct project** - look for "wavelength-lore" or similar in the project dropdown at the top

**Step 2: Navigate to API Credentials**
1. In the left sidebar, look for **"APIs & Services"** 
2. Click **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Credentials"**
3. OR use the search bar at top and search for "credentials"

**Step 3: Find Your Compromised API Key**
1. On the Credentials page, look for **"API Keys"** section
2. You should see a list of API keys
3. Look for key: **AIzaSyDEsAFgYaBlttBdjh[REDACTED]**
4. It might be named something like:
   - "Browser key"
   - "Server key" 
   - "YouTube API Key"
   - Or just "API Key" with creation date

**Step 4: Check What Services This Key Accesses**
1. Click on the key name or the edit icon (pencil)
2. Look at **"API restrictions"** - this shows what APIs it can access
3. Common ones: YouTube Data API v3, Maps API, Firebase API, etc.

**Step 5: Delete the Compromised Key**
1. In the key details, look for **"Delete"** button (usually red)
2. OR go back to credentials list and click the trash/delete icon next to the key
3. Confirm deletion when prompted
4. **DO THIS IMMEDIATELY** - don't wait

**Step 6: Create New Restricted API Key**
1. Back on Credentials page, click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"**
2. Select **"API key"**
3. A new key will be generated - **COPY IT IMMEDIATELY**
4. Click **"RESTRICT KEY"** (very important!)

**Step 6.5: Enable Required APIs (IMPORTANT!)**
**If you don't see YouTube APIs in restrictions, you need to enable them first:**

1. **Go to APIs & Services** ‚Üí **"Library"** (in left sidebar)
2. **Search for "YouTube Data API v3"**
3. Click on **"YouTube Data API v3"**
4. Click **"ENABLE"** button
5. Wait for it to enable (may take a minute)
6. **Repeat for any other APIs you need:**
   - YouTube Analytics API (if you use analytics)
   - YouTube Reporting API (if you need reports)
   - Maps API (if you use Google Maps)
   - Any other Google APIs your app uses

**Alternative: Enable APIs through API Dashboard**
1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Dashboard"**
2. Click **"+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES"** at the top
3. Search for "YouTube Data API v3" 
4. Click on it and click **"ENABLE"**

**Step 7: Now Properly Restrict Your New Key**
1. **Go back to Credentials** ‚Üí Edit your new API key
2. **Name your key**: "Wavelength Lore YouTube API - 2025"
3. **Application restrictions**: Choose based on your setup:
   - **HTTP referrers** if used in browser (add your domain like `*.wavelength-lore.com`)
   - **IP addresses** if used on server (add your server IP)
   - **None** only if absolutely necessary (NOT recommended)
4. **API restrictions**: 
   - Select **"Restrict key"**
   - Now you should see **YouTube Data API v3** in the list!
   - Choose **ONLY** the APIs you actually use:
     - ‚úÖ YouTube Data API v3 (if you need YouTube)
     - ‚úÖ YouTube Analytics API (if you track analytics)
     - ‚ùå Don't enable APIs you don't use
5. Click **"SAVE"**

**Common APIs You Might Need to Enable:**
- **YouTube Data API v3** - For video info, playlists, channels
- **YouTube Analytics API** - For video performance data
- **YouTube Reporting API** - For channel reports
- **Maps JavaScript API** - If you use Google Maps
- **Geocoding API** - If you convert addresses to coordinates
- **Places API** - If you search for places

**Troubleshooting: Can't Find Your Key?**

**Option A: Check All Projects**
1. At the top of Google Cloud Console, click the project dropdown
2. Switch between different projects you might have
3. Check each project's credentials

**Option B: Check Through Firebase**
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your wavelength-lore project
3. Project Settings ‚Üí General tab
4. Scroll down to "Web API Key" - this might be the same key

**Option C: Search by Key Value**
1. In Google Cloud Console, use the search bar
2. Search for: "AIzaSyDEsAFgYaBlttBdjh[REDACTED]"
3. It might show up in search results

**Option D: Check Billing**
1. Go to "Billing" in Google Cloud Console
2. Look for API usage charges
3. This can help identify which project has the API key

**Step 8: Update Your Application**
```bash
# Update your .env file:
YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_new_restricted_api_key_here"
```

## üîí FINAL SECURITY INCIDENT COMPLETION CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Credential Rotation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Firebase**: Delete old web app, create new one, update .env
- [ ] **AWS**: Delete compromised key, create new IAM user with minimal permissions, update .env  
- [ ] **YouTube**: Delete old API key, create new restricted key, update .env

### Phase 2: Verification & Testing üß™
- [ ] **Update .env file** with ALL new credentials (no old values remaining)
- [ ] **Test application functionality**:
  ```bash
  # Test your app still works with new credentials
  npm start
  # or
  node index.js
  ```
- [ ] **Verify Firebase connection** - check forum posts load
- [ ] **Verify AWS services** - check file uploads/CDN if applicable  
- [ ] **Verify YouTube API** - check video embeds/data if applicable

### Phase 3: Security Hardening üõ°Ô∏è
- [ ] **Commit .env changes** (the template files, NOT the .env with secrets)
- [ ] **Update .gitignore** to ensure .env is never committed:
  ```bash
  echo ".env" >> .gitignore
  echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
  echo ".env.*.local" >> .gitignore
  ```
- [ ] **Force push changes** to overwrite Git history with exposed keys:
  ```bash
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Security: Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables"
  git push --force-with-lease
  ```

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Documentation üìä
- [ ] **Monitor for 48 hours**:
  - Check AWS CloudTrail for unauthorized API calls
  - Monitor Firebase usage dashboard
  - Watch Google Cloud Console for unusual API usage
  - Check billing for unexpected charges
- [ ] **Set up alerts**:
  - AWS Budget alerts for spending
  - Firebase usage quotas
  - Google Cloud billing alerts
- [ ] **Schedule next key rotation** (90 days from now)

### Phase 5: Incident Closure üìù
- [ ] **Create incident summary**:
  - What happened: GitHub detected exposed credentials in repository
  - Impact: Potential unauthorized access to Firebase, AWS, YouTube APIs
  - Resolution: All credentials rotated, environment variables implemented
  - Lessons learned: Never commit credentials, use .env files properly
- [ ] **Archive this security response document**
- [ ] **Update team/documentation** about proper credential management

### üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
**Your .env file still contains the OLD COMPROMISED Firebase APP_ID!**

Update your .env file RIGHT NOW with your new Firebase credentials:
```bash
# The API_KEY stays the same (this is normal and cannot be changed):
API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"  # ‚úÖ SAME - this is normal!

# But you MUST update the APP_ID with the new one from Firebase Console:
APP_ID="your_new_app_id_from_firebase_console"  # ‚úÖ This MUST be different!
```

**üîë CLARIFICATION OF WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE:**
- ‚ùå **API Key CANNOT be changed** - it's permanent for the project
- ‚úÖ **APP_ID MUST be changed** - this is what provides security
- ‚úÖ **AWS credentials MUST be changed** - create new access keys
- ‚úÖ **YouTube API key MUST be changed** - create new restricted key

### üìã POST-INCIDENT BEST PRACTICES:
1. **Never commit .env files** to any repository
2. **Use .env.example** templates without real values
3. **Rotate credentials every 90 days** 
4. **Use minimal permissions** for all API keys
5. **Enable monitoring/alerts** for all cloud services
6. **Regular security audits** of your repositories

---
**Incident Status: üü° PENDING** (waiting for .env update and testing)
**Next Action: Update .env file with new Firebase credentials, then test application**

### 3. **WHAT I'VE ALREADY FIXED**

‚úÖ **Removed hardcoded credentials** from all forum template files
‚úÖ **Replaced with environment variables** using EJS templating
‚úÖ **Created .env.example** template for future reference
‚úÖ **Verified .gitignore** includes .env file

#### Fixed Files:
- `views/forum/home-page.ejs`
- `views/forum/create-post-page.ejs` 
- `views/forum/post-page.ejs`
- `views/forum/user-profile.ejs`
- `views/forum/recent.ejs`
- `views/forum/category-page.ejs`

### 4. **NEXT STEPS FOR YOU**

#### A. Update Your .env File:
```bash
# After rotating credentials, update .env with NEW values:
API_KEY="your_new_firebase_api_key"
AUTH_DOMAIN="wavelength-lore.firebaseapp.com"
DATABASE_URL="https://wavelength-lore-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"
PROJECT_ID="wavelength-lore"
STORAGE_BUCKET="wavelength-lore.firebasestorage.app"
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_new_sender_id"
APP_ID="your_new_app_id"

# New AWS Credentials
ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_new_aws_access_key"
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_new_aws_secret_key"

# New YouTube API Key
YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_new_youtube_api_key"
```

#### B. Verify Security:
1. **Test the application** after updating credentials
2. **Monitor logs** for any issues
3. **Set up proper monitoring** for future credential usage
4. **Consider using AWS Secrets Manager** for production

#### C. Git History Cleanup:
1. **Consider using git filter-branch** to remove credentials from git history
2. **Or create a fresh repository** if history cleanup is too complex
3. **Force push** cleaned history (‚ö†Ô∏è coordinate with team first)

### 5. **PREVENTION FOR FUTURE**

‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Already implemented
‚úÖ **.gitignore**: Already configured
üîÑ **Consider**: 
- AWS Secrets Manager for production
- Firebase App Check for additional security
- API key restrictions and quotas
- Regular credential rotation schedule
- Security scanning tools (like GitGuardian)

### 6. **TIMELINE FOR ACTION**

- **IMMEDIATE** (next 1 hour): Rotate Firebase and AWS credentials
- **TODAY**: Update .env file and test application  
- **THIS WEEK**: Implement additional security measures
- **ONGOING**: Monitor for unauthorized usage

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Do not commit any more code until ALL credentials are rotated and the .env file is updated with the new secure values.
