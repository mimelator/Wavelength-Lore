# GitHub Actions ECR Deployment Fix

## Issue
GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the warning:
> Your docker password is not masked. See https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login#docker-credentials for more information.

## Root Cause
The workflow was using the older `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1` action with incorrect credential handling, which caused Docker credentials to be exposed in logs.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Action Versions
- **Checkout**: Updated from `v3` to `v4`
- **ECR Login**: Updated from `v1` to `v2` 
- **Docker Buildx**: Updated from `v2` to `v3`
- **AWS Credentials**: Added dedicated `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` step

### 2. Fixed Credential Management
**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Log in to Amazon ECR
  id: login-ecr
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

- name: Log in to Amazon ECR
  id: login-ecr
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2
```

### 3. Improved ECR Registry Handling
**Before:**
```yaml
env:
  ECR_REGISTRY: 170023515523.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com  # Hardcoded
```

**After:**
```yaml
env:
  ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}  # Dynamic from login step
```

### 4. Enhanced Docker Image Tagging
- Added commit SHA tagging for better version tracking
- Both `latest` and short commit SHA tags are now pushed
- Added informational logging

### 5. Fixed CloudFront Invalidation
- Removed redundant environment variables (now handled by configure-aws-credentials)
- Fixed conditional check syntax
- Simplified the invalidation step

## Security Improvements

1. **Masked Credentials**: AWS credentials are now properly masked in logs
2. **Reduced Secret Exposure**: Removed unnecessary duplication of credentials
3. **Dynamic Registry**: Registry URL is obtained securely from the login step

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Docker passwords are now properly masked
2. **Maintainability**: Uses latest action versions with better support
3. **Traceability**: Multiple image tags for better deployment tracking
4. **Reliability**: Improved error handling and logging

## Required GitHub Secrets

Ensure these secrets are configured in your GitHub repository:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key with ECR permissions
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret access key
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: (Optional) CloudFront distribution ID for cache invalidation

## Testing

The workflow will now:
1. ✅ Properly mask Docker credentials in logs
2. ✅ Use the latest secure action versions
3. ✅ Build and push Docker images with proper tagging
4. ✅ Optionally invalidate CloudFront cache

Push to the `main` branch to test the updated workflow.
